Random stuff, call it art, call it toys, idk

## [Text](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/text/)

My attempt at re-creating a cool text effect I saw in a League of Legends intro video circa 2015. I also slapped a BPM tapper on it because why not.

## [Arrows](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/arrows/index.html)

Based on Boids, and my first foray into p5js. I spent some time improving the code here but it's still slower than I would've liked.

## [Watercolor](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/watercolor/index.html)

An attempt at generative art, simulates some watercolor splotches.

## [Disorder](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/disorder/index.html)

Another attempt at generative art.

## [Rain](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/rain/index.html)

My first attempt at making a short experience. You don't get the full experience unless you try to experience it again. (Very laggy on mobile because I didn't know to set the viewport.)

## [People](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/people/index.html)

Some personal data visualization...

## [Glass](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/glass/index.html)

An idea that probably won't ever come to fruition.

## [Sliders](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/sliders/index.html)

A flimsy toy that is surprisingly easy to break.

## [Saying Goodbye](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/saying-goodbye/index.html)

I was feeling really angsty one day, and wanted to type some words into the void. But I also didn't want the words to instantly disappear. Instead they fade away over a few minutes, and you can copy out what you've said to preserve it in a text file somewhere.

## [Lightswitch](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/lightswitch/index.html)

My first project with websockets. A simulated lightswitch that is synced across the internet. Amusingly, the first feature I had to add was the ability to detect and ban botters and scripters, because nearly half of the people I shared it with immediately tried to abuse it.

## [Color Sort](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/color-sort/index.html)

A friend asked, "Why can't you just sort by hex code?" Color is a multi-dimensional space! So here's a mini-demo of various ways to sort color.

## [Timer](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/timer/index.html)

An experiment in timing. Mainly because my phone timer was too obnoxious for use while meditating, but the screen turns off anyway so this isn't very useful. I did learn that SVG properties are fully React-controllable. Neat.

## [Candles](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/candles/index.html)

Leave a message that'll last 8 hours. I learned from the lightswitch and you can only light one candle at a time. Ephemeral messages, who knows if anyone will ever see what you wrote, or who wrote what you read?

## [Please Don't Go](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/please-dont-go/index.html)

<details>
  <summary>Click to see spoilers</summary>
  Inspired by other ephemeral things, ban evasion from the lightswitch (people used proxies to keep running their bots!), and ad-tech tracking. When you leave, something happens to the bunny. You might not ever see the bunny ever again. It'll track you by browser fingerprint and IP address, even into incognito mode and across devices.

## [Music Playground](https://www.ajaska.com/experiments/music-playground/index.html)

Multiplayer music creation. I had to hack through minified source code for this one.
